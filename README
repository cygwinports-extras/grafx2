grafx2
------------------------------------------
This program is dedicated to everybody who knows what a single pixel is. 
Its layout is not very different from the famous Deluxe Paint or 
Brilliance, so it will be quite easy to handle it if you know at least 
one of these programs. If you aren't used to the art of drawing with up 
to 256 colors, it will be a little more difficult for you, but you 
should give it a try (or more, because most of the power of this program 
won't show up on the first try).

Runtime requirements:
  cygwin-1.7.0-67
  libgcc1-4.3.4-3
  libpng12-1.2.35-10
